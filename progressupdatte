### ‚úÖ Progress Summary

**Player Character Setup:**

* Created and finalized a custom `BP_PlayerCharacter` Blueprint
* Ensured proper possession via custom `BP_PlayerController`
* Verified GameMode is set correctly with the updated Pawn and Controller

**Enhanced Input System:**

* Set up **Enhanced Input Mapping Contexts (IMCs)** properly
* Resolved issue with movement not responding due to missing bindings
* Corrected axis bindings and swizzle configurations to enable:

  * `W` ‚Äì Forward
  * `S` ‚Äì Backward
  * `A` ‚Äì Left
  * `D` ‚Äì Right

**Toggle Mask Mechanic:**

* Created the `ToggleMask` input action and event system
* Linked mask state logic with post process volumes
* Implemented feedback through Post Process Weight blending

**Debugging Milestones:**

* Troubleshot a wide array of issues:

  * Input not triggering
  * Player not moving
  * Controller not possessing pawn
* Refactored blueprint naming and structure to prevent confusion
* Validated character possession and movement via output logs

### üîç Outstanding Tasks / Next Steps

* [ ] Add jump functionality (IA\_Jump + logic)
* [ ] Add visual UI for mask toggle (icon, screen tint, or effect)
* [ ] Begin work on interaction inputs (E key for object/NPC use)
* [ ] Flesh out school interior environment (starting from main entrance)
* [ ] Document current Blueprint setups (Controller, Character, Input)

### üß† Notes

* Unreal Engine's Enhanced Input System requires exact mapping between **IMCs, Input Actions, and Blueprints**.
* Swizzle modifiers are essential when working with Vector2D movement to align Unreal‚Äôs internal axes.
* Even with everything configured, GameMode and Pawn setup will block progress if not correct.
